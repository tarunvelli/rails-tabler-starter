## Goals

This starter is aimed at Rails developers familiar with the framework, aiming to facilitate seamless development with the following principles:

* No DSL: Avoid unnecessary Domain Specific Language (DSL) complexity.
* Simplicity over Efficiency: Prioritize simplicity in implementation over excessive optimization.
* Avoid Complex Frontend Functionality: Keep frontend functionality straightforward and manageable.

## Overview

* Pre-equipped with essential models such as

    * Users
    * Roles
    * Plans
    * Subscriptions

* User authentication & authorization

    * Authentication via [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)
    * [OmniAuth](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/OmniAuth%3A-Overview) integration to extend authentication using third-party providers
    * Authorization through [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit)

* Background worker & scheduler

    * Utilizes [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/) and [sidekiq-scheduler](https://github.com/sidekiq-scheduler/sidekiq-scheduler)

* Role management

    * Standard roles available across spaces
    * Custom role creation per space
    * Supports fine grained permissions per role

* Multiple user namespaces support

    * Utilizes the `Space` model to represent user namespaces (e.g., teams, organizations).
    * Example use case for turning on multi-space mode is a saas application
    * Example use case for turning off multi-space mode is an internal org tool

* Pre built UI layouts

    * High quality UI elements and layouts from [Tabler](https://tabler.io/)

* Development focussed

    * [Annotate](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models) - Annotate Rails classes with schema and routes info
    * [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) - A static analysis security vulnerability scanner
    * [Byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) - Simple debugger
    * [Dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) - Load environment variables from `.env`
